# Simple Kanban Board with React and Zustand

## Overview

This is a simple Kanban Board application built using React and Zustand for state management. The primary focus of this project is functionality, and the designs are intentionally kept basic.

## Features

- **Kanban Board:** The application provides a basic Kanban board with three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

- **Task Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks can be dragged and dropped between columns to update their status.
